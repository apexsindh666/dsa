# dsa

Overview
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations in C++ / Python / Java (adjust based on your language). The goal of this project is to strengthen problem-solving skills, understand fundamental data structures, and prepare for competitive programming or technical interviews.



Features


Implementation of Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Hashing, and Heap.

Common sorting and searching algorithms.

Solutions to classic DSA problems from platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and Codeforces.

Optimized and well-commented code for learning purposes.
